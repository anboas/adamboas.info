## Abstract

This paper argues that Agent Control Plane (ACP) capability is a warfighting imperative because the decisive variable is no longer model quality alone, but governed delegation throughput under contested conditions. Across military and commercial ecosystems, agent operations are converging on the same structural need: Mission Control for autonomous execution.

The evidence shows six compounding realities:

1. multi-agent orchestration is becoming the default scaling pattern,
2. swarms and low-cost autonomy compress operational timelines,
3. C2 integration debt remains a binding constraint,
4. governance/accountability obligations are hardening,
5. adversarial pressure concentrates at protocol, context, and connector boundaries,
6. acquisition pathways are already scaling autonomy faster than traditional governance mechanisms.

Conclusion: ACP is not a feature layer. It is command infrastructure for delegated autonomy.

## 1) Research objective and decision linkage

### Primary research objective

Build a coherent, evidence-grounded model of how agent orchestration and swarms change modern conflict, and translate that into:

- ACP-RA design primitives,
- DAD organizational authorities,
- near-term implementation priorities.

### Decision linkage

- **ACP-RA feed:** what must be engineered and enforced in the control plane.
- **DAD memo feed:** what must be institutionally governed, mandated, and audited.

## 2) Method and analytical framework

### 2.1 Evidence corpus

This paper integrates three evidence layers:

1. **Public operational/strategic evidence** (labs, policy, defense reporting, think tanks, standards signals).
2. **Academic evidence** (multi-agent systems, MARL, swarms, orchestration, safety/governance, adversarial resilience).
3. **Programmatic implementation evidence** (CJADC2 constraints, Replicator timelines, C-UAS scaling, protocol governance shifts).

### 2.2 Analytical structure

To preserve coherence across a broad source base, the paper applies a claim-evidence-implication structure in each section:

- **Claim:** what strategic or operational condition is changing.
- **Evidence:** policy, operational, and academic signals that establish the change.
- **Implication:** what ACP-RA and DAD must do differently in architecture and governance.

The paper is organized by mission-relevant topic clusters rather than chronology so each section can be read as a standalone decision input. A companion extraction log is maintained in `writing/notes/2026-02-12-annex-a-evidence-ledger.md` to keep source-level evidence traceable as the draft iterates.

## 3) Topic cluster A: Mission Control and C2 compression

### Core claim A1

Warfighting advantage increasingly depends on reducing delegation-to-effect latency while preserving bounded control.

### Key evidence threads

- GAO CJADC2 reporting: progress exists, but framework, measurement, and integration barriers remain substantial. [35]
- Frontier-style enterprise agent platforms frame deployment/governance stack as the bottleneck, not model IQ alone. [1]
- Multi-agent platform announcements now emphasize orchestration, role delegation, and operational boundaries. [49][50][51]

### Implication for ACP-RA

ACP must implement Mission Control functions as core control-plane behaviors:

- intent packets,
- delegation scopes,
- policy checkpoints,
- effect verification,
- exception and rollback pathways.

## 4) Topic cluster B: Swarms, volume autonomy, and force survivability

### Core claim B1

Scale changes everything: command quality degrades unless orchestration and policy enforcement are built for saturation conditions.

### Key evidence threads

- CNAS: cheap drone mass creates persistent threat; layered C-UAS and scaled defenses are necessary. [54]
- CNA: PRC swarm research is explicitly connected to Taiwan-relevant scenarios and lessons from ongoing conflicts. [55]
- Army sustainment evidence shows swarm concepts moving into logistics and support-area security, not only maneuver units. [53]
- Replicator 1/2 confirms autonomy and counter-autonomy are moving through accelerated fielding paths. [47][56]

### Implication for ACP-RA

ACP cannot assume sparse event flow. It must be saturation-resilient:

- queue-aware prioritization,
- consequence-tier gating,
- budget-aware action authorization,
- deterministic degraded-mode operation.

## 5) Topic cluster C: Interoperability, protocols, and orchestration ecosystems

### Core claim C1

Interoperability standards increase both coordination power and attack surface. Protocol governance becomes decisive.

### Key evidence threads

- A2A and MCP trajectory indicates rapid protocolization of agent-to-agent and tool-context interactions. [5][6][51][52]
- Linux Foundation governance move for A2A suggests ecosystem-wide standardization momentum. [52]
- Multi-vendor enterprise platform competition is converging on orchestration + identity + operational controls. [49][50][51]

### Implication for ACP-RA

ACP should enforce protocol-bound trust, not app-bound trust:

- signed capability cards,
- attested agent identity,
- constrained delegation chains,
- anti-replay and provenance at message boundaries.

## 6) Topic cluster D: Safety, legal accountability, and command responsibility

### Core claim D1

At machine speed, accountability is impossible without architectural provenance.

### Key evidence threads

- Responsible-use policy frameworks are becoming lifecycle-oriented, not principle-only. [40][41][42][43][44]
- ICRC/SIPRI logic remains central: responsibility is retained by humans and institutions; it cannot transfer to systems. [45][46]
- Frontier risk artifacts emphasize deceptive/failed tool-use conditions as practical risk domains. [12][13][14]

### Implication for ACP-RA

Every high-consequence action path requires attributable evidence:

- who delegated,
- what scope was active,
- what policy checks fired,
- what tools executed,
- what verified effect occurred.

## 7) Topic cluster E: Adversarial resilience and contested operation

### Core claim E1

The highest-value attack surfaces are no longer only endpoints; they are orchestration pathways and context channels.

### Key evidence threads

- OpenClaw/ClawHub incidents and follow-on warnings demonstrate agent supply-chain attack behavior in the wild. [25][26][27][28]
- RAND and CSIS analyses stress adaptive adversaries, contested information advantage, and distributed mission command logic. [38][39]
- Adversarial MARL and deception-attack literature supports architecture-level robustness requirements.

### Implication for ACP-RA

ACP should treat resilience as a control objective with explicit design controls:

- partition-safe execution,
- context provenance and confidence fusion,
- connector attestation,
- rapid revocation/reconstitution.

## 8) Topic cluster F: Infrastructure, energy, and industrial base constraints

### Core claim F1

Compute and power constraints shape autonomy feasibility and tempo as much as algorithmic capability.

### Key evidence threads

- Capital and power are increasingly first-order autonomy enablers/constraints. [29][30][31][32]
- Operational concentration risk rises when autonomy depends on fragile infrastructure concentration.

### Implication for ACP-RA

ACP must support heterogeneous model tiers and edge fallback profiles, including low-connectivity and low-power execution envelopes.

## 9) Synthesis: ACP-RA design primitives

The following primitives emerge as non-optional from cross-topic synthesis.

### 9.1 Authority primitives

- Commander Intent Packet (CIP)
- Delegation Authority Token (DAT)
- Trust Scope Manifest (TSM)

### 9.2 Enforcement primitives

- action-time policy checks
- consequence-tiered authorization
- cross-agent interaction control

### 9.3 Evidence primitives

- action trajectory logging
- evidence envelopes (context hash + tool receipts + effect verification)
- forensic replay support

### 9.4 Resilience primitives

- degraded-mode profiles
- partition-safe operation
- rejoin and reconstitution controls

### 9.5 Supply-chain primitives

- signed skills/connectors
- provenance attestation
- emergency revocation channels

### 9.6 Evaluation primitives

- mission-context benchmark suites
- adversarial injection suites
- drift-triggered rollback rules

## 10) Direct feed into DAD memo (organizational design)

### 10.1 Why DAD remains structurally necessary

No single functional lane can own delegated autonomy at force scale. DAD is required as a cross-domain control authority integrating doctrine, policy, and technical enforcement.

### 10.2 Minimum DAD authorities (research-derived)

- approve/deny delegation scope baselines,
- enforce no-conformance/no-scale rule,
- mandate evidence and telemetry standards,
- direct degraded-mode posture policy,
- suspend tool registries or inter-agent channels,
- run autonomy red-team and containment drills,
- require pre-scale eval-pack conformance.

### 10.3 Initial implementation sequence

- **Phase 1:** authority and baseline publication,
- **Phase 2:** enforcement plumbing + controlled fieldings,
- **Phase 3:** compulsory conformance and scored oversight.

## 11) Topic-by-topic research synthesis (current extraction pass)

### 11.1 Mission control and C2 compression

**Thesis.** Future advantage depends on shortening decision-to-effect cycles without losing command integrity.

**Evidence extracted.**
- GAO finds DOD still lacks a comprehensive CJADC2 framework with measurable goals and shared lessons-learned mechanisms, producing fragmented service-level efforts and slower integration. [35]
- RAND’s 2026 framework finds AI does not erase the need for mission command; hybrid centralized/decentralized C2 remains preferable because information placement, not raw cognition, remains the limiting variable. [38]
- CSIS reporting on Russia indicates wartime adaptation away from monolithic C2 modernization toward tactical software that compresses reconnaissance-to-strike timelines. [37]

**Research summary.** Across U.S. oversight, competitor adaptation, and independent strategic analysis, the pattern is consistent: C2 architecture and software integration are now decisive levers.

**Deductions.**
- ACP-RA should optimize for command-latency compression under policy constraint, not for model novelty.
- DAD should treat C2 software integration debt as a strategic risk, not an IT backlog issue.

### 11.2 Swarm operations and force survivability

**Thesis.** Scale and attritability are changing force economics faster than legacy force-design and control processes.

**Evidence extracted.**
- DIU states Replicator 1 targets deployment of multiple thousands of all-domain attritable autonomous systems on an 18–24 month timeline, with Replicator 2 focused on counter-sUAS at critical installations and force concentrations. [47][56]
- CNA’s assessment of PRC writings finds active research, testing, and scenario development for drone swarms in Taiwan-relevant operations, including assault/blockade contexts and explicit counter-swarm functions. [55]
- U.S. Army sustainment analysis shows swarm concepts extending beyond maneuver to convoy protection and support-area security, driven by manpower constraints and early-warning demands. [53]

**Research summary.** Swarms are now a force-wide planning issue, not a niche autonomous platform issue.

**Deductions.**
- ACP-RA needs saturation governance, queue discipline, and consequence-tier action control as baseline functionality.
- DAD should enforce doctrine/eval updates that cover sustainment and rear-area swarm employment, not only frontline strike use.

### 11.3 Interoperability, protocol governance, and orchestration ecosystems

**Thesis.** As agent interoperability matures, protocol governance becomes the real control surface.

**Evidence extracted.**
- Google’s A2A launch positions cross-vendor agent coordination as core enterprise requirement and explicitly ties protocol design to secure information exchange and multi-agent collaboration. [5]
- Transfer of A2A into Linux Foundation governance with broad hyperscaler/enterprise participation indicates rapid ecosystem-level standardization pressure. [52]
- OpenAI Frontier frames the primary enterprise bottleneck as deployment and governance conditions (context, permissions, boundaries), not base model capability. [1]

**Research summary.** Industry direction is converging on open, multi-agent, cross-system operation with security and governance embedded at protocol and orchestration layers.

**Deductions.**
- ACP-RA should enforce trust at agent-message and connector boundaries, including identity, capability attestation, and provenance.
- DAD should own minimum interoperability-control standards before scale authorization.

### 11.4 Governance, legal accountability, and responsible use

**Thesis.** Governance must be operational, testable, and attributable at execution time.

**Evidence extracted.**
- NATO’s revised AI strategy reinforces Responsible Use principles and emphasizes TEV&V, interoperability, and alliance-wide implementation mechanisms. [40]
- The U.S. Political Declaration process provides a growing normative state-level framework for responsible military use, including implementation dialogues among endorsing states. [43]
- SIPRI/ICRC accountability framing remains clear: legal and moral responsibility remains with human and institutional actors. [45][46]

**Research summary.** The policy environment is shifting from abstract principles to operationalized controls, validation regimes, and documented accountability.

**Deductions.**
- ACP-RA must produce auditable decision and action provenance for high-consequence functions.
- DAD should mandate that no autonomy capability scales without attributable evidence trails and validated oversight controls.

### 11.5 Adversarial resilience and contested operations

**Thesis.** The operationally critical attack surfaces are orchestration pathways, software dependencies, and context integrity.

**Evidence extracted.**
- OpenClaw ecosystem incidents and analyses highlight skill/extension supply-chain risk in agentic systems and demonstrate practical compromise pathways. [25][26][27][28]
- RAND highlights persistent offense-defense competition and argues durable advantage comes from adaptation under sophisticated adversary pressure, not assumptions of one-time superiority. [38][39]
- CSIS battlefield observations indicate adversary adaptation cycles now prioritize software pathways that improve kill-chain speed and operational flexibility. [37]

**Research summary.** Agentic warfare resilience is an architecture and governance problem as much as a model-performance problem.

**Deductions.**
- ACP-RA must include revocation, isolation, reconstitution, and adversarial-injection testing as core controls.
- DAD should institutionalize recurring red-team cycles tied directly to deployment authority.

### 11.6 Compute, power, and industrial constraints

**Thesis.** Autonomy scale is bounded by compute and power infrastructure, not just algorithms.

**Evidence extracted.**
- Reuters reporting on major AI buildout describes supersized data-center race dynamics and gigawatt-class facility planning as core enablers of frontier capability scaling. [31]
- Reuters reporting on Anthropic power-cost commitments indicates grid-upgrade and utility-cost externalities are now strategic deployment constraints requiring explicit mitigation. [32]
- NATO’s revised strategy also flags compute intensity, energy demand, and associated governance implications as alliance-level concerns. [40]

**Research summary.** Power and infrastructure are now first-order constraints shaping deployment tempo, geography, and strategic resilience.

**Deductions.**
- ACP-RA should explicitly support tiered compute profiles, degraded operation, and edge/low-power fallback.
- DAD should include infrastructure-readiness criteria in autonomy scaling decisions.

## 12) Conclusions

1. Multi-agent orchestration and swarm operations are not hypothetical future capabilities; they are current operational realities.
2. C2 and mission-control quality now bound autonomy effectiveness more than isolated model quality.
3. Protocol and connector surfaces are becoming primary trust boundaries.
4. Governance without operational enforcement is inadequate under machine-speed delegation.
5. ACP-RA should be treated as warfighting infrastructure, and DAD as its institutional control authority.
